Pop up that only shows up once per day- base it on time stamps in side effect ass. table? or new table to account for point below.


Should we add a "no I dont want to log today option"? otherwise we might get false entires. Maybe a new table just for this. (BRING this up in report)
    -Important to prevent people from just submitting whatever symptoms to get the popup out of their face (giving us inaccurate data)

multiple choice clickable list. intensity optional (for analysis, exclude null values)- make it super easy to enter. sliding thing? also 1-10 for more variety
    -slidey intensity list (default = 0 = not reported) mark the 0 very clearly. or maybe toggle active sliding thing? 

Should have active drugs- activated until the user says no, maybe add new table which stores all drugs a user is taking and if they are active or not. Only active ones are logged. 

Write at top "currently logging for $active_drugs" so they know what they are logging
