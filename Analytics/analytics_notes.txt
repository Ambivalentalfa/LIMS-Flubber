** On drug page, only see general (all, age group, etc. Not traceable to single users) **


Ideas: 
- For side effects, which drug has it reported the most frequently
- Maybe the average amount of time it takes for a side effect's intensity to decrease (as reported by users) on a particular drug
    - line graph over time (linear regression?)
    - both available for individual users on their profile, and average for a drug
    - only use the ones with intensity? 
    - 
- Average monthly side effects, (for one or several side effects). Bar plot? 


- Look into visualization tools to link into site & to SQL: Python, Tableau, other?

EXTRA SPECIAL IDEA
- similarity analysis
    - Recommendations 
    - (data mining course-- these things often occur together, rule generation/analysis)
(need to somehow only give good recommendations, meaning that we only want to give recommendations to drugs that people are happy with) 


in future we could add rule mining for combinations of drugs and diseases
